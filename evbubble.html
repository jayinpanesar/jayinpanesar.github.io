      <h1 class="article-title">Is there an EV Price Bubble?</h1>
      <img class="image" src="images/ev.jpg"  width="100%">
      <p>There is no doubt that electric cars are a huge focal point as we prepare for the future. With Boris Johnson bringing forward his ban on new petrol and diesel car sales and Tesla becoming a consistent profit making business resulting in the addition to the S&P 500, the future for electric cars is certainly going to become a reality whether it is ready or not, but is is being overvalued?</p>
      <p>On 31st August 2020 the TSLA stock underwent a 5:1 stock split after a huge 80% rise in value from their announcement just 20 days before. Like any stock split, the price became too high and a reduction in face value is likely to attract more investors but there is large evidence supporting the stock being overvalued as it surpasses a large amount of price targets with little profit to support it.</p>
      <p>However, it is not just Tesla being entered into the 'EV price bubble' with the likes of NIO, up over 400% since it's initial listing in September 2018 and Xpeng's lucrative $1.5 billon IPO in mid 2020, there is certainly a sense of 'hype' brewing around Wall Street, but the companies are yet to come anywhere close to selling half amount of cars as it has investors casting a shadow of doubt over Johnson's plan for a large selection of EV cars to come to market by 2030.</p>
      <p>Some will say that all bubbles eventually pop, but will this happen to the EV industry or will it thrive off its investors and live up to its' hefty price tags? All we can say is that everything will become clearer with the forced entry into the British car market.</p>
