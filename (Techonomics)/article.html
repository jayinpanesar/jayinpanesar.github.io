      <h1 class="article-title">Tesla are making a $25,000 car?</h1>
      <p>The electric car company had a fantastic year in 2020, delivering around 36% more cars than in 2019, benefited by the addition of the Model Y in March. In total, 500 thousand cars were delivered mostly consisting of Model 3 and Model Y which come in significantly cheaper than Tesla's more expensive Model X and Model S, however the Tesla lineup could see a change most likely in the next few years due to an unveil of a $25,000 car. </p>

      <p>In an interview with tech YouTuber Marques Brownlee in 2018, Musk explained making a $25,000 car is something the company could do, "if we work really hard maybe we could do that in 3 years"</p>

      <h3>How are Tesla going to acheive this?</h3>
 
      <p>Incredibly, they have plans to cut the cost of batteries in half to under $100 per kilowatt hour, while they have also outlined they are developing a battery which will last 1 million miles. This would allow significantly less frequent car upgrades, meaning one car could last a lifetime.</p>

      <p>Elon Musk's plan all along was to initally create a low volume, expensive car (Tesla Roadster), and then invest that money into a relatively less expensive, higher volume car (Model S) and then invest that money into a less expensive, much higher volume car (Model 3).</p>
